# PubmedSearch
Just a basic program to get me acquainted with chrome extensions. Will probably add more functionality once I start seeing
some use for this kind of program. 

Made to look up a specific query that you are interested in into pubmed. Then it'll list the top 20 hits in the popup window.

Improvements to make to Version 2
1. Use POST request and submit form.
2. See if different responseType works for output. 
3. Try callbacks with messageListeners.
4. Make links clickable.
5. Format text so it's nicer - maybe update make other elements using popup.js.
6. Choose better icon.
7. Iniitalize query / have a button to change the query.
